# BRJS + AngularJS Todo MVC

This application provides an example of how AngularJS can be used with BladeRunnerJS to build a modular and scalable application.

The application is based on the [AngularJS Todo MVC app](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/architecture-examples/angularjs), but splits the application up by feature:

* Input - add a new Todo item
* Items - a list of todo items
* Filter - overview information about the todos e.g. Number of items completed

For more information see the [Using AngularJS with BladeRunnerJS](#TODO) blog post.
